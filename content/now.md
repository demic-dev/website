I am currently in my third year of Computer Science Bachelor, at University of Milan. This means that in less than a year I will be a Bachelor Graduate. Can't wait!

## Projects I am involved in

* With my awesome team, the 7th of May we won University Startup Challenge hackaton. This means that we got a spot for FondazioneUnimi's incubator. Another challenge begins. Cannot wait to see where it bring us! Check out [Polyneta](https://polyneta.com)!

## Non-career related stuff

* I recently entered into the rabbit hole of [self-hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) and [Nix-OS](https://nixos.org/). This means that I am moving all my devices to have a reproducible environment and I am on my way to move all my digital life to self-hosted solutions. Currently, I am using NextCloud, Immich and Calibre.

* Linked to the project above, I am also on my way to set a development workflow completely suited for me. Learning Lua and Nvim, currently I am using it for org-mode (considering switch to Emacs!!) but slowly porting to use it also as a full IDE.

* Since March, I started learning to play piano. The journey is really hard and long, but I am sure it is worth it.

* Lately, I started constantly reading again. I have to thanks my ereader which I can bring everywhere. Some books I recently read and which I loved:

    * [Careless People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Careless_People)
    * [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter)
    *    [Sapiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind)
