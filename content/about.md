# TL;DR

__Ciao!__ My name is Michele De Cillis, this is my website. I am a __software engineer__ and a __tech entusiast__.

Based in Milan, I am in my final year of BSc in Computer Science, where I am deep diving into advanced theory and best practices in CS. I also have almost three years of work experience in frontend and mobile development. I learnt to write _quality code_ that is both __efficient__ and __scalable__.

Strongly passionate about __digital minimalism__, I firmly believe that technology should serve people. My goal is to build software that is __simple__ and __intuitive__ to use, contributing to improving the daily lives of users.

## My journey so far, in detail

#### High School

I took my first steps in the world of _software development_ during high school, where I learned the basics of the computer science world and participated in some _Arduino_ competitions. I also participated in the development of a school [tombola](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombola), where we successfully handled more than _1000_ users online at the same time. Our application has been recognized by the [national newspaper](https://web.archive.org/web/20250516095452/https://www.itisandria.it/component/content/article/2-non-categorizzato/2373-la-tombolata-dell-itis-e-su-repubblica.html).

#### Working

Afterwards, I worked as a mobile and frontend software engineer for almost three years, for two different companies. I worked on e-commerce and highly dynamic websites with real-time client-server communication and a total of roughly _200k_ monthly visits. With this experience, I developed strong technical skills and a strong ability to work in team, both in person and remotely.

One of the _challenges_ I faced, was to implement a __microservice__ in the web client which allowed the user to try the product in AR, before buying it. I loaded the microservice only when needed, without weigh too much the website. Also, by handling it indipendently, avoiding unnecessary _rerendering_ of the whole website.

#### Bachelor

After that, during year 2022/23, I decided to expand my knowledge by enrolling in a Computer Science degree at [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/bachelor/computer-science), motivated by my curiosity about the academic world. I also continued to work as a freelancer on various minor projects to keep my software development skills sharp.

During the year 2023/24, to fullfill my needs in international knowledge and networking, I decided to take an exchange program (_Erasmus+_) at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), in France, which offered me the opportunity to learn about [machine learning](https://github.com/demic-dev/als-biomarker-identification-project), NLP and to collaborate in highly international teams. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and enriched me both personally and professionally.

In my third year of BSc, me and some friends joined an [hackaton](https://www.unistartupchallenge.com/), with the challenge to create innovative ideas to solve cities problems. Within three weeks, we worked hard to provide a good idea and to build a prototype of our platform. The hard work paid off and we won. The prize was a spot inside the [FondazioneUnimi](https://www.fondazioneunimi.com/) incubator, one of the best european incubators, according to [FinancialTimes](https://rankings.ft.com/incubator-accelerator-programmes-europe/ranking/europes-leading-start-up-hubs).
