# tl;dr

__Ciao!__ I'm Michele De Cillis, and welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a software engineer and a tech enthusiast. In my final year of BSc in CS, I am deep diving into advanced theory and best practices in CS. I also have almost three years of work experience in frontend and mobile development. I learnt to write _quality code_ that is both __efficient__ and __scalable__. I think that technology should _help_ people to _grow_ and express their best.

Strongly passionate about __digital minimalism__, I firmly believe that technology should serve people. My goal is to build software that is __functional__, __intuitive__, and __enjoyable__ to use, contributing to improving the daily lives of users.

## My journey so far, in detail

I took my first steps in the world of _software development_ during high school, where I learned the basics of the computer science world and participated in some _Arduino_ competitions. I also participated in the development of a school bingo, where we successfully handled more than _1000_ users online at the same time. Our application has been recognized by the [national newspaper]().

Afterwards, I worked as a mobile and frontend software engineer for almost three years, for two different companies. I worked on e-commerce and highly dynamic websites with real-time client-server communication and a total of roughly _200k_ monthly visits. With this experience, I developed strong technical skills and a strong ability to work in team, both in person and remotely.

One of the _challenges_ I faced, was to implement a __microservice__ in the web client which allowed the user to try the product in AR, before buying it. I loaded the microservice only when needed, without weigh too much the website. Also, by handling it indipendently, avoiding unnecessary _rerendering_ of the whole website.

After that, during year 2022/23, I decided to expand my knowledge by enrolling in a Computer Science degree at University of Milan, motivated by my curiosity about the academic world. I also continued to work as a freelancer on various minor projects to keep my software development skills sharp.

During the year 2023/24, to fullfill my needs in international knowledge and networking, I decided to take an exchange program (_Erasmus+_) at Universit√© Paris-Saclay, in France, which offered me the opportunity to learn about _machine learning_ and to collaborate in highly international teams. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and enriched me both personally and professionally.
