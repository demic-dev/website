I am in my final year of a <i>BSc in Computer Science</i>, where I am deep diving into advanced theory and best practices in CS. I also worked for almost three years as a <b>frontend</b> and <b>mobile</b> developer, learning to write <i>quality code</i> that is both <b>efficient</b> and <b>scalable</b>. My school of thought is that technology should <i>help</i> people to <i>grow</i> and express their best. When I'm not learning or making projects, I love cycling, hiking."

                "content": "I took my first steps in the world of <i>software development</i> during high school, where I learned the basics of the computer science world and participated in some <i>Arduino</i> competitions. I also participated in the development of a school bingo, where we successfully handled more than <i><b>1000</b></i> users online at the same time. Our application has been recognized by the <1>national newspaper</1>.<br/><br/>Afterwards, I worked as a <2>mobile</2> and <3>front-end</3> software engineer for almost three years. I worked on e-commerce and highly dynamic websites with real-time client-server communication and a total of roughly <i><b>200k</b></i> monthly visits. With this experience, I developed strong technical skills and a strong ability to work in team, both in person and remotely.<br/>One of the <i>challenges</i> I faced, was to implement a <b>microservice</b> in the web client which allowed the user to try the product in AR, before buying it. I loaded the microservice only when needed, without weigh too much the website. Also, by handling it indipendently, avoiding unnecessary <i>rerendering</i> of the whole website.<br /><br />Two years ago, I decided to expand my knowledge by enrolling in a <4>computer science degree</4>, motivated by my curiosity about the academic world. I also continued to work as a freelancer on various minor projects to keep my software development skills sharp.<br /><br />During the year 2023/24, to fullfill my needs in international knowledge and networking, I decided to take an exchange program (<i>Erasmus+</i>) at <5>UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay</5>, in France, which offered me the opportunity to learn about <i><6>machine learning</6></i> and to collaborate in highly international teams. This experience taught me the importance of teamwork and enriched me both personally and professionally.<br /><br />Strongly passionate about <b><i>digital minimalism</i></b>, I firmly believe that technology should serve people. My goal is to build software that is <b>functional</b>, <b>intuitive</b>, and <b>enjoyable</b> to use, contributing to improving the daily lives of users."
